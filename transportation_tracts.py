Spatial Justice in Transportation
===================
**FYS: Maps that Matter**

**Introduction:**
 - Transportation is a major factor that affects the access to opportunities, but not all communities have the same access to transportation. This notebook explores  transportation patterns in Nassau and Kings counties by using U.S. Census Bureau data to highlight  how residents commute to work. The goal is to achieve this by breaking down the use of different modes of transportation with different demographics  to make sense of the spatial justice issues affecting the mobility and transport in these areas.

**Background:**


- Transportation is important for many individuals in their everyday lives as it allows access to education, healthcare, employment, and other opportunities. Although public transportation is a crucial need, many low income and marginalized communities have trouble accessing transportation due to reliability and affordability. In Nassau and Kings Counties, transportation is proof of social inequality, with some communities getting benefits from great transportation while others lacking the minimum resources. These problems are not just inconvenient but also highlight the ever growing division and disparities between communities.
Research has shown that wealthier communities with higher car dependency have better public transportation, while low income communities are affected by the poor quality of transportation. A paper published by the Civil Rights Project at Harvard University and the Center for Community Change highlights how transportation policies have prevented many communities from social and economic opportunities such as not being able to go to interviews on time or not being able to attend social gatherings such as festivals or carnivals. The paper argues that new standards should be implemented to ensure that everyone gets equal transportation.

Everyday Conversation:
- The issue of inequality in transportation has been increasing in many communities. Community organizations and advocacy groups have been advocating for equality in transportation for underserved communities.

Research Questins:
- How do transportation patterns in Kings and Nassau counties differentiate among demographic groups?
- How does transportation inequality affect healthcare, education, and other opportunities for low income communities?

"""**Conclusion:**
 - The data gathered from B03002 (race/ethnicity demographics) and B08141 (transportation) allows us to analyse transportation inequalities in Nassau and Kings Counties. The data highlights inequities in low income communitie when accessing public transportation. Kings County communities mostly rely on public transportation while in Nassau County, private vehicles such as cars are most used. The highlighted inequalities show how transportation is connected to demographics especially those communities who are marginalized.

 Analyzing these two datasets together, we can understand how transportation inequalities have affected both urban and suburban communities. Although Kings County benefits most from public transportation, its low income communities struggle with poor quality transit, while Nassau County's reliance on personal vehicles creates problems for those without access to a car. To solve these issues, we need equitable investments, public/community driven plans, and policy reforms.
